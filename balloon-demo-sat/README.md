Files for a simple working prototype balloon demo.

These are model files for a 1U cubesat that are meant to be 3D printed, filled
	with a Raspberry Pi, battery, and rpi camera, and flown to act as the
	satellite.

Original model aquired from: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3523258
Files have been renamed from the original for ease of use.

satCorner: Corner column and outline frame for one side.
satFace: Top and bottom frame.
satFaceModified: Same as satFace, but with the center hole enlarged to fit the
	lens on an RPi Camera. (.SLDPRT is imported and modified from original, .stl
	is exported for printing.)

To build: Print four of the satCorner model, and two of the satFaceModified (or alternately, one modified and one original).
